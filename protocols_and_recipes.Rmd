# Planting & Aphids

*Updated: 2023 November 13*

**Procedure**

1.  Evaluate plants
    -   Dryness
    -   Deadness
    -   Aphid contamination
        -   If you find an aphid: text Tory or Katie.
        -   Isolate the plant, ideally in an aphid cage.
        -   Check if there is a backup of that plant.
        -   If so, plant may have to be moved to the aphid room.
    -   *Note: never go into the plant room after being in the aphid room on the same day.*
2.  Pots
    -   Clear the sink.
    -   Empty soil from the old pots (after freezing) into the trash bag.
        -   *Note: do not leave defrosting trash bags out for \>3 days.*
    -   Place empty old pots in sink and scrub/rinse to remove dirt.
    -   Add 1:10 bleach to water (by eye) into a tub in the sink and soak scrubbed/rinsed pots for \~12 hours.
    -   Rinse off the bleach from the pots and set on bench to dry.
        -   *Note: be careful not to get bleach on clothes or hands.*
3.  Planting
    -   Use dry pots with two trays underneath and up to 6 pots/tray.

        -   Use smaller pots for plants like fava bean/pea and bigger pots for plants like barley/cucumber.

    -   Loosen a bag of soil and fill pots up to inner rim.

    -   Seeds are located in the fridge on the second shelf.

        -   Use Johnny‚Äôs seeds.

    -   Plant seeds according to the post-it note on the countertop shelf.

        -   *Note: calculate any fava plants 2 weeks before experiments*
        -   *Note: always make sure there are at least 12 fava bean plants for the aphids.*

        | Plant     | Amount      |
        |-----------|-------------|
        | Cucumbers | 3 seeds/pot |
        | Beans     | 4 beans/pot |
        | Turnips   | 1 pinch/pot |
        | Barley    | 1 pinch/pot |
        | Dock      | 1 pinch/pot |
4.  Watering
    -   The hose is in the adjacent room.
    -   Turn on the tap in the adjacent room and the switch for the water in located on the hose nozzle.
        -   3 secs/plant on high setting.
5.  Sacrificing Plants to the Aphids
    -   Take out ¬æ of the plants in a cage and put them in a trash bag.
        -   Use a different trash bag for each aphid species.
    -   Replace those 3 old plants with fresh plants.
    -   When watering plants, wash can between aphid cages.

    -   *Note: Make 1 tube/pot and don‚Äôt forget a blank!*

2.  Transfer a colony of *Pseudomonas* from plate to media.

3.  Incubate in benchtop shaker at 28C overnight (\~18 hrs).

**Day 1: Spraying**

2.  Pellet cells by centrifuging for 10 min on max speed

3.  Discard supernatant.

4.  Add 1 mL 10mM MgCl2 buffer and resuspend/vortex.

5.  Pellet and discard supernatant again.

6.  Add \~25 mL 10mM MgCl2 buffer and resuspend/vortex.

7.  Transfer 100 ul of sample to a blank cuvette.

8.  Measure OD of bacterial resuspension (include blank!).

    -   Goal: OD = 0.2

9.  Transfer 20 mL of bacterial resuspension into autoclaved spray bottle.

    -   Clean tops using ethanol and sterile water.

10. Retrieve 14 day old plants from plant room and place in biosafety cabinet.

11. Spray \~20 mL bacterial solution onto all the leaves and all plant surfaces (stem, top, bottom) of pot until runoff (starting to drip).

12. Allow plant to dry in the biosafety cabinet.

13. Move plant to tent downstairs and note time.

14. Incubate for 72 hours in a tent at 70F and 85% humidity.

**Day 4: Sampling**

1.  Retrieve plants from plant room and place in biosafety cabinet.

2.  Sterilize cork borer and forceps using ethanol flame and place in a sterile petri dish in biosafety cabinet.

3.  Take 10 samples from all over each plant in the pot.

    -   Place all samples from a plant in a single falcon tube, 10 discs/tube.

        -   Will end with end with 3 falcon tubes and 30 samples if sampling 3 plants (1 pot).
