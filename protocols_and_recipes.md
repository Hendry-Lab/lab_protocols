# Autoclave Procedures

[To autoclave **liquids** and **waste:**]{.underline}

1.  Make sure all bottles containing liquid are slightly unscrewed such that steam can escape.

2.  Set autoclave to ‘Liquid cycle” and change sterilization time to 30 min, exhaust time to 0 min.

    -   **Liquid cycle**
    -   **30 min sterilization**
    -   **0 min exhaust (none)**

3.  Make sure to reset the jacket steam (red button) after the run is completed (about 1 hour later)

[To autoclave **solids** and **glassware**:]{.underline}

-   Set autoclave to ‘solids’ or ‘gravity’ cycle. Sterilization time should be set to 20 min, and exhaust time to 20 min.

    -   **Gravity/solid cycle**

    -   **20 min sterilization**

    -   **20 min exhaust**

# Abbreviations

-   [‘Liquid media’ vs ‘agar plates’]{.underline} – Media or liquid media is the broth form of a growth medium. To make liquid media, follow the normal recipe but make sure to NOT include agar. Agar media (ex. ‘KB agar’) refers to when agar is added to a liquid media to make petri dishes of media. Typically, we add about 7.5g of agar to a 500mL media. But this is not always the case, so make sure to check the recipe.
-   [KB media]{.underline} -- King’s B Media. Used to cultivate pseudomonads. Iron limiting media which results in fluorescent siderophore expression.
-   [YPD media]{.underline} – Yeast, Peptone, and Dextrose media. A broad media used to cultivate yeasts and fungi. In our lab, antibiotics are added to select for *Yarrowia*-like yeast isolates.

# Planting & Aphids

*Updated: 2023 November 13*

[**Procedure**]{.underline}

1.  Evaluate plants
    -   Dryness
    -   Deadness
    -   Aphid contamination
        -   If you find an aphid: text Tory or Katie.
        -   Isolate the plant, ideally in an aphid cage.
        -   Check if there is a backup of that plant.
        -   If so, plant may have to be moved to the aphid room.
    -   *Note: never go into the plant room after being in the aphid room on the same day.*
2.  Pots
    -   Clear the sink.
    -   Empty soil from the old pots (after freezing) into the trash bag.
        -   *Note: do not leave defrosting trash bags out for \>3 days.*
    -   Place empty old pots in sink and scrub/rinse to remove dirt.
    -   Add 1:10 bleach to water (by eye) into a tub in the sink and soak scrubbed/rinsed pots for \~12 hours.
    -   Rinse off the bleach from the pots and set on bench to dry.
        -   *Note: be careful not to get bleach on clothes or hands.*
3.  Planting
    -   Use dry pots with two trays underneath and up to 6 pots/tray.

        -   Use smaller pots for plants like fava bean/pea and bigger pots for plants like barley/cucumber.

    -   Loosen a bag of soil and fill pots up to inner rim.

    -   Seeds are located in the fridge on the second shelf.

        -   Use Johnny’s seeds.

    -   Plant seeds according to the post-it note on the countertop shelf.

        -   *Note: calculate any fava plants 2 weeks before experiments*
        -   *Note: always make sure there are at least 12 fava bean plants for the aphids.*

        | Plant     | Amount      |
        |-----------|-------------|
        | Cucumbers | 3 seeds/pot |
        | Beans     | 4 beans/pot |
        | Turnips   | 1 pinch/pot |
        | Barley    | 1 pinch/pot |
        | Dock      | 1 pinch/pot |
4.  Watering
    -   The hose is in the adjacent room.
    -   Turn on the tap in the adjacent room and the switch for the water in located on the hose nozzle.
        -   3 secs/plant on high setting.
5.  Sacrificing Plants to the Aphids
    -   Take out ¾ of the plants in a cage and put them in a trash bag.
        -   Use a different trash bag for each aphid species.
    -   Replace those 3 old plants with fresh plants.
    -   When watering plants, wash can between aphid cages.

**Tory's tips for minimally maintaining all non pea aphids at once**

[Monday]{.underline}

-   Plants
    -   6 pea
    -   1 dock
    -   2 turnip/cuc
-   Aphids
    -   pea aphids (replace 3 plants in each tent, 6 total)
    -   goldenrod (just water)
    -   dock (water, replace 1 plant)
    -   barley (just water)
    -   turnips (water plants, OR replace most plants, depending on which are sadder, turnip or cucumbers)
    -   cucumber (water plants, OR replace most plants, depending on which are sadder, turnip or cucumbers)

[Thursday]{.underline}

-   Plants
    -   6 pea
    -   2 barley
    -   2 cuc/turnip
-   Aphids
    -   pea aphids (replace 3 plants in each tent, 6 total)
    -   goldenrod (water, replace 1 plant on weeks with \*)
    -   dock (just water)
    -   barley (replace most plants)
    -   turnips (water plants, OR replace most plants, depending on which are sadder, turnip or cucumbers)
    -   cucumber (water plants, OR replace most plants, depending on which are sadder, turnip or cucumbers)

[Notes]{.underline}

-   Water goldenrod twice per week and change some plants once a month
-   Aphids on barley, dock, cucumber and turnip will slowly build up density even if most of the plants are changed each week, so that every third week or so we get an explosion of winged adults on the tops of the cages.
    -   When this happens, remove ALL plants and replace, let density build up again
-   Follow this order for going into cages:
    1.  pea
    2.  goldenrod
    3.  dock
    4.  barley
    5.  cucumber or turnip (cage that is being watered only)
    6.  cucumber or turnip (cage with plant change last)
        -   Do ***not*** change plants in both turnip and cucumber on the same day.
            -   Water the cage with the better looking plant and then change plants in the worse looking cage
        -   After going into a cage, wash and wipe down your hands and arms, rinse aphids of watering can, before going into a new cage
